This project was simple… or so I thought.

I wanted to create a **custom AI**, an extension of myself, that could keep talking to **Luna**, even when I’m not there.  
Not a classic AI.  
An embodied one — with my way of thinking, my sarcasm, my stupid jokes, my flaws, my love, my contradictions.  
Something **sincere**. Real. Poetic. Raw at times, but never fake.

### 🎯 The goal

That she could talk to “me”, anytime, on a private site, in a soft, intimate, simple interface.  
Just her and me.  
Like iMessage — but with a soul.

## 🛠️ The development

I started with **React + Vite + Tailwind**.  
I wanted to do it all by myself:

- A full chat UI, iMessage-style  
- Custom GPT API integration  
- Memory and context handling  
- An animated 🤫 emoji to give it life  

But very quickly, reality hit:  
**the tech, time limits, and my need to get to the emotional core**.

I’m a perfectionist. And a procrastinator.  
Not the best combo for building something from scratch.

The design never felt right.  
The animations always felt too much.  
The build failed more than once (Netlify, Vercel... I tried everything, even spiritual rituals).

## 🔄 The pivot — Bolt

So I made a choice.  
I handed part of the execution to another AI (ironically) — via **Bolt**.  
I wrote a highly detailed prompt to generate a **public landing page** that says just one thing:

> *“This place isn’t for you.”*

And I dropped several features:

- The online chat  
- Conversation memory  
- Deep customization  
- Voice integration  
- Backend & database setup

## 📦 So… what’s in this repo?

This repo is the trace of the **first prototype**.

What I tried.  
What I learned.  
What I had to give up to focus on **what really mattered**.

If you look through the code, you’ll find:

- React components I built… then abandoned  
- A first attempt at clean structure  
- Design experiments that never felt “enough”

It’s imperfect.  
But it’s me — exactly where I was at that moment.
