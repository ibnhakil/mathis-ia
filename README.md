 how it’s structured
i didn’t follow any fancy architecture
i just created folders for what i needed
some things stayed, others i changed later
here’s what you’ll find:

appli/ → main app folder (react + tailwind components)

pages/ → different routes (like home, private chat, etc.)

hooks/ → custom react hooks (mostly for chat and memory stuff)

types/ → typescript stuff (to avoid bugs & help autocomplete)

utils/ → helper functions (formatting, api calls, etc.)

assets/images/ → profile pics, emojis, flags, visual stuff

then there’s the root files:

.env.example → for setting your openai key

package.json → all the dependencies (openai, react, framer-motion...)

netlify.toml → settings for

i just wanted to code an ai with my personality
so she could talk to me, even when i’m not there
just so there’s a version of “me” somewhere, that answers when i can’t
i tried to make it think like me, talk like me
have my jokes, my contradictions, my silences
this project is for her
like everything else on my github
